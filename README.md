# GreenCoverage Analyzer_1

Vegetation Coverage Analyzer
A Python-based computer vision tool for estimating green vegetation coverage percentage in images using HSV and LAB color space analysis.
Description
This tool analyzes images to determine the percentage of area covered by vegetation. It uses advanced color space transformations and multiple masking techniques to accurately detect various types of green vegetation, including standard greens, dark greens, and brownish vegetation.
Features
•	Multi-color space processing (HSV & LAB)
•	Customizable color detection ranges
•	Morphological operations for noise reduction
•	Simple command-line interface
•	Fast and efficient processing
Installation
1.	Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2.	Install required dependencies:
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
Usage
Run the script and provide the image path when prompted:
bash
python vegetation_coverage.py
Example output:
text
Please enter the image path: field_image.jpg
Total green coverage percentage: 45.67%
How It Works
The algorithm follows these steps:
1.	Image Loading: Reads the image from the specified path
2.	Color Space Conversion: Converts the image to both HSV and LAB color spaces
3.	Color Masking: Applies multiple color range filters to detect different vegetation types
4.	Mask Combination: Combines all vegetation masks into a final mask
5.	Morphological Processing: Cleans the mask using opening and closing operations
6.	Percentage Calculation: Computes the coverage percentage
Customization
You can easily customize the color detection ranges by modifying these arrays in the code:
python
# Standard green vegetation in HSV
lower_green1 = np.array([35, 40, 40])    # [H_min, S_min, V_min]
upper_green1 = np.array([85, 255, 255])  # [H_max, S_max, V_max]

# Dark green vegetation in HSV  
lower_green2 = np.array([25, 30, 20])
upper_green2 = np.array([95, 255, 150])

# Brownish vegetation in LAB
lower_brownish_green = np.array([70, 110, 110])  # [L_min, A_min, B_min]
upper_brownish_green = np.array([100, 150, 150]) # [L_max, A_max, B_max]
Color Space Information
HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)
•	Hue: Color type (0-180 in OpenCV)
•	Saturation: Color intensity (0-255)
•	Value: Brightness (0-255)
LAB (Lightness, A, B)
•	L: Lightness (0-255)
•	A: Green-Red axis (-127 to 128)
•	B: Blue-Yellow axis (-127 to 128)
Applications
•	Agricultural field analysis
•	Environmental monitoring
•	Urban green space assessment
•	Forestry management
•	Research and academic projects
Troubleshooting
•	Image not loading: Check file path and ensure the image exists
•	Poor detection: Adjust color ranges for your specific vegetation types
•	Installation issues: Verify OpenCV and NumPy are properly installed
