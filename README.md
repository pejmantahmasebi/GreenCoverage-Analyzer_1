# GreenCoverage Analyzer_1
Vegetation Coverage Analyzer
A Python-based computer vision tool for estimating green vegetation coverage percentage in images using HSV and LAB color space analysis.
Description
This tool analyzes images to determine the percentage of area covered by vegetation. It uses advanced color space transformations and multiple masking techniques to accurately detect various types of green vegetation, including standard greens, dark greens, and brownish vegetation.
Features
•	Multi-color space processing (HSV & LAB)
•	Customizable color detection ranges
•	Morphological operations for noise reduction
•	Simple command-line interface
•	Fast and efficient processing
Installation
1.	Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2.	Install required dependencies:
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
Usage
Run the script and provide the image path when prompted:
bash
python vegetation_coverage.py
Example output:
text
Please enter the image path: field_image.jpg
Total green coverage percentage: 45.67%
